## Codebase Patterns
- Use `spawnSync` from node:child_process for git commands (consistent pattern in helpers/git.ts)
- Services should cache expensive operations (e.g., DiffProcessor caches diff content)
- Handle git operations gracefully - return empty string or undefined if .git not found instead of throwing
- Logger utility (Logger.warn, Logger.info) is standard for logging across services

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba902-e075-72ae-a5ef-ad44244ad180
- Created DiffProcessor service class in src/services/DiffProcessor.ts
- Implemented getDiffContent() method using spawnSync to retrieve git diff HEAD
- Implemented hasPatternInDiff() supporting string, RegExp, and array patterns
- Cached diff content for reuse across multiple pattern checks
- Graceful error handling - returns empty string if .git missing or git fails
- Files changed: src/services/DiffProcessor.ts
- Quality checks: build ✓, lint ✓, typecheck ✓
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The codebase follows a pattern where git operations use spawnSync (not promises)
  - Services are placed in src/services/ directory alongside RuleProcessor
  - Logger is imported from helpers/logger.js for consistent logging
  - Error handling returns gracefully rather than throwing - follow this pattern for reliability

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba902-e075-72ae-a5ef-ad44244ad180
- Added FlaggedFile interface to RuleProcessor with properties: file, rule, errorLevel
- Extended RuleResult interface to include flaggedFiles array
- Updated processRule() to initialize flaggedFiles as empty array
- Files changed: src/services/RuleProcessor.ts
- Quality checks: build ✓, lint ✓, typecheck ✓
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Interfaces are defined locally in service files (not exported separately)
  - FlaggedFile stores references to the Rule object itself (not just name/id)
  - Error level comes from rule.level (already part of Rule interface)

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba902-e075-72ae-a5ef-ad44244ad180
- Imported DiffProcessor into RuleProcessor
- Instantiated DiffProcessor as class property
- Cache diff content once in processRules() using cachedDiffContent
- Updated processRule() to check if matched files' patterns exist in cached diff
- Create FlaggedFile entries for files with pattern matches in diff
- Log violations with file, rule pattern, and error level
- Files changed: src/services/RuleProcessor.ts
- Quality checks: build ✓, lint ✓, typecheck ✓
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Cache diff content at the processRules level (not in each rule check) for efficiency
  - Use rule.find (if present) for pattern checking, fallback to rule.pattern
  - Check if pattern exists IN the DIFF content, not just that the file exists
  - flaggedFiles only populated if diff content retrieved successfully

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba902-e075-72ae-a5ef-ad44244ad180
- Added graceful handling for missing .git directory - logs warning and continues
- Wrapped pattern checking in try/catch to handle errors without crashing
- Check for empty diff content (indicates git unavailable) and skip validation
- All pattern types handled: RegExp (test), Array (some), String (includes)
- Log warnings when diff unavailable or pattern checking fails
- Files changed: src/services/RuleProcessor.ts
- Quality checks: build ✓, lint ✓, typecheck ✓
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Empty string from getDiffContent means no .git or git failed (intentional design)
  - Always check for empty diff before processing to avoid unnecessary work
  - Wrap pattern checking in try/catch even though implementation is safe (defensive coding)
  - Log warnings for graceful failures - users need visibility into what's happening

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba902-e075-72ae-a5ef-ad44244ad180
- Exported FlaggedFile and RuleResult interfaces from RuleProcessor for use in controllers
- Updated CommandRunner to capture and process ruleResults
- Created outputFlaggedFilesSummary() method to display violations
- Output includes summary of total files per error level with emoji headers
- Each flagged file shows: filename [errorLevel] - Rule: pattern, Pattern: details
- Sorted by error level (error > warn > info) then alphabetically by filename
- Handles all pattern types (RegExp, Array, String) when displaying
- Files changed: src/services/RuleProcessor.ts, src/controllers/CommandRunner.ts
- Quality checks: build ✓, lint ✓, typecheck ✓
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Export interfaces if they're needed by other modules (controllers, handlers, etc.)
  - Use descriptive variable names (patternString not patternStr) - enforced by linter
  - Avoid Array.reduce() - use loops for clarity (unicorn/no-array-reduce rule)
  - Non-null assertion (!) requires type guards to satisfy TypeScript
  - Logger.print() outputs on same line, Logger.println() adds newline

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba93e-d58e-77bb-b969-3e08dcbca6e6
- Added getDiffContent(commitReference: string = 'HEAD'): string to src/helpers/git.ts
- Implements proper error handling: throws Error if git fails or .git not found
- Returns stdout as string (no empty string fallback - errors propagate)
- Updated DiffProcessor to import and use getDiffContent() from git helper
- Removed spawnSync import from DiffProcessor (now only imports getDiffContent)
- Renamed parameter from commitRef to commitReference to fix linting (unicorn/prevent-abbreviations rule)
- Files changed: src/helpers/git.ts, src/services/DiffProcessor.ts
- Quality checks: build ✓, lint ✓ (ESLint, Prettier, TSC)
- Commit: feat: US-001 - Consolidate Git Operations into Helper
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Parameter names must be descriptive (commitRef → commitReference) per unicorn/prevent-abbreviations rule
  - Error handling in git operations: throw errors instead of returning empty strings for centralized handling
  - The codebase now expects errors to propagate up to the caller for centralized error handling
  - getDiffContent is now the single source of truth for all git diff operations

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba945-80c6-7698-a4f5-71acebf40874
- Vitest infrastructure already fully configured (vitest ^4.0.16 installed as dev dependency)
- vitest.config.mjs exists with proper TypeScript configuration and test patterns
- npm scripts test:unit and test:unit:coverage already configured and functional
- Created example test file tests/unit/src/helpers/git.spec.ts with TypeScript and vitest globals
- Verified test infrastructure works: tests pass, coverage reports generate, all quality checks pass
- Files changed: tests/unit/src/helpers/git.spec.ts, ralph/prd.json
- Quality checks: build ✓, lint ✓, typecheck ✓, tests ✓
- Commit: feat: US-002 - Set Up Vitest Infrastructure
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Vitest test files use .spec.ts naming convention (not .test.ts) per vitest.config.mjs
  - Tests are located in tests/unit/src/ mirroring the src/ directory structure
  - Vitest globals are auto-imported (describe, it, expect, vi, beforeEach, etc.) via unplugin-auto-import
  - Test files automatically get full TypeScript support and inference
  - npm run test:unit runs with coverage enabled by default in this project

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba94c-8c6d-7664-aec1-6c7dada48583
- Created src/helpers/patternMatcher.ts with hasPatternMatch(pattern, content): boolean
- Function handles RegExp, string[], and string patterns uniformly
- Updated DiffProcessor.hasPatternInDiff() to use the utility function
- Updated RuleProcessor.findFilesWithPattern() to use the utility function
- Removed private hasPatternMatch() method from RuleProcessor
- Removed duplicate pattern matching code from both services
- Created comprehensive unit tests in tests/unit/src/helpers/patternMatcher.spec.ts (28 tests)
- Tests cover: string patterns, RegExp patterns, array patterns, edge cases, integration scenarios
- Files changed: src/helpers/patternMatcher.ts (new), src/services/DiffProcessor.ts, src/services/RuleProcessor.ts, tests/unit/src/helpers/patternMatcher.spec.ts (new), ralph/prd.json
- Quality checks: build ✓, lint ✓, typecheck ✓, tests ✓ (31 tests pass)
- Commit: feat: US-003 - Extract Reusable Pattern Matching Utility
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pattern matching logic should be centralized in helpers/patternMatcher.ts for reuse
  - The hasPatternMatch function handles empty content by returning false (defensive)
  - Array patterns use Array.some() for short-circuit evaluation (efficient)
  - Tests should avoid RegExp object comparisons (use === instead of pattern === /regex/)
  - All test files should use .spec.ts naming convention in tests/unit/ directory

  Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019ba952-772d-750a-826e-a9ad4cd1c1b2
  - Created src/services/Reporter.ts with Reporter class for batched output collection
  - Implemented methods: onRuleProcessed(rule), onFileMatched(file), onViolation(file, rule, level)
  - Implemented report(): void that outputs collected violations by error level with flagged files list
  - Reporter uses Set for files (prevents duplicates) and array for violations (preserves order)
  - Output format: total violations count, grouped by level (Error > Warning > Info), sorted files
  - Created comprehensive test suite with 12 tests covering all methods and scenarios
  - Tests mock Logger, verify method calls, and validate report output structure
  - Files changed: src/services/Reporter.ts (new), tests/unit/src/services/Reporter.spec.ts (new), ralph/prd.json
  - Quality checks: build ✓, lint ✓, typecheck ✓, tests ✓ (43 tests total)
  - Commit: feat: US-004 - Create Reporter Service
  - **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use Level enum (Level.Error, Level.Warning, Level.Info) - not string literals
  - Set is ideal for deduplicating files; array for violations to maintain order
  - Report should group by error level in consistent order: Error > Warning > Info
  - Use toSorted() instead of sort() (ESLint unicorn/no-array-sort rule)
  - Use spread operator [...set] instead of Array.from() (ESLint unicorn/prefer-spread rule)
  - Mock entire Logger module in tests (not individual methods) for cleaner test setup
  - Logger.success() for "no violations" case; Logger.println() for regular output
